### Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a software engineer with experience in Java, Spring, Hibernate, TypeScript, and Angular. Besides coding, I love:

- **🧩 Problem Solving**: I have a knack for solving complex problems, and I enjoy the dopamine rush that comes with finding innovative solutions.
- **👨🏻‍💻 Technology**: A technology enthusiast, I'm always eager to explore new technologies and frameworks to enhance my skills.
- **🎵 Music**: From rock to jazz, I find solace and inspiration in the captivating power of melodies.
- **💪 Weightlifting**: When I'm not typing away at my keyboard, you can find me at the gym.
- **🌱 Farming**: In addition to my technical expertise, I also have hands-on experience in farming. It's a rewarding and grounding endeavor.
- **🐶 Dogs**: I absolutely adore dogs, and I have a German Shepherd named Oscar.

Feel free to connect and collaborate to create meaningful software that makes a positive impact!

Happy coding!
